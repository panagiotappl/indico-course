Here you can add what we call a \"notification ruleset\", i.e. a specific email template to send when a rule is matched. For example: if an abstract is submitted, a certain email notification will be sent.</p>\n<p>Choose a <em>Title</em> for your ruleset, and select the email template that you want, for example \u201cSubmit\u201d. Then you will have to select a rule, for example \u201csubmit\u201d, like your email template. click on <em>Add new rule</em> and select <em>Submitted</em>. Click on <em>Save</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"course/en/images/conference_abstract_def.png\" /></p>\n<p>You can add new rulesets by clicking on <em>Add new one</em>, for example for when a abstract is <em>Accepted</em> or <em>Rejected</em>.</p>\n<h3>Configure abstract submission</h3>\n<p>From the \"Call for Abstracts\" management page, click on <em>Settings</em> on the <em>Submissions</em> raw which leads to to the <em>Configure abstract submission</em> screen.</p>\n<p>Write in an <em>Announcement</em> you want to be displayed when users submit their abstracts.</p>\n<p>Select the options that suit you, such as:\n- allowing the selection of multiple tracks,\n- making the track selection mandatory</p>\n<p>etc.</p>\n<p>If you want to limit the abstract submission to a selected few, you can add a limited number of users in <em>Authorized submitters</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"course/en/images/conference_abstract_submit_config.png\" /></p>\n<p>Scroll down for the instructions box, if you wish to insert some additional advice to submitters.

In this page, you can add users as <em>Reviewers</em> and <em>Conveners</em>.

You will be offered the possibility to <em>Search</em> for existing users and add them.</p>\n<p>Click on <em>Save</em> once you\u2019ve chosen all the relevant people for these roles.</p>\n<p>Now click on <em>Settings</em>, at the right of <em>Roles</em> to define, as event manager, a set of questions, to  be used as a guide for the reviewers and the scale for the answers to these questions, from 0 to 5 for example.</p>\n<p>Below you have certain options such as allowing conveners to accept or reject an abstract, allowing comments in your review page, and allow contributors in the comments.</p>\n<p>Under <em>Review questions</em>, type in your questions, click at the disk icon on your right to save your question and click on <em>Add</em> if you want to add a new question, for example \u201cwhat is the quality of the content?\"</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"course/en/images/conference_review_instructions.png\" /></p>\n<p>Finally, write in some instructions for the Reviewers and for the Judges, who need to ultimately accept or reject an abstract based on the review.</p>\n<p>Once you have chosen your <em>Scale</em> and your <em>questions</em>, click on <em>Save</em> at the bottom of the page.</p>\n<h3>The Book of Abstracts</h3>\n<p>The book of abstracts is a configurable and downloadable document (in pdf) where only the accepted abstracts will be published.</p>\n<p>To configure the book of abstracts, click on <em>Settings</em> from the relevant raw of the \"Call for Abstracts\" management page.</p>\n<p>Write any additional text that will be included on the document, and select the sorting criteria for the abstracts\u2019 appearance in the book.  Click on <em>Save</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"course/en/images/conference_abstracts_book_list.png\" /></p>\n<h3>The List of Abstracts</h3>\n<p>This is the list of <strong>all</strong> abstracts and it is built automatically once the \"Call for Abstracts\" is open.\nYou can rearrange this list by clicking on <em>Manage</em>.</p>\n<h3>Open the Call for Abstracts</h3>\n<p>From the same management page, you can click on <em>Schedule</em> and select the start, the end and modification deadline of your call for abstracts.

As you can see in the image below, payments are disabled by default.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"course/en/images/Conference_Reg_Config_1.png\" /></p>\n<p>To change this, simply click on <em>Enable payments</em>, and <em>Confirm</em>.\nAt this point, a button called <em>Payments</em> will appear on the left banner. Click on this button to see several payment options. Click on one of the payments options available to enable it, e.g. choose the <em>Bank transfer</em> option, in which case you will have to select <em>Enable</em>, and insert the IBAN code of the bank account where the payment should be deposited.\nYou can do the same for other options such as <em>PayPal</em>, using the PayPal ID you needed for the Conference payment.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"course/en/images/Conference_Reg_Config_2.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Related Registration configuration steps</h3>\n<p>From the <em>Registration</em> page of the event management area, click on the <em>Create form</em> button.</p>\n<p>Give a <em>Name</em> to your registration form. The most important of the options available is the <em>Moderated</em> workflow option.

Enter the necessary data and click on <em>Add</em>.</p>\n<p>You can add various new fields, suitable for your event, by clicking on the \"+\" signs of the sections defined.
